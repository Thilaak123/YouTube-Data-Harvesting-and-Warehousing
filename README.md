YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL and Streamlit

Uses the YouTube Data API to extract channel, video, and comment metadata.

Supports data collection from up to 10 YouTube channels using their Channel IDs.

Extracted data includes channel details, video stats, and top-level comments.

Stores data in a structured format using MySQL or PostgreSQL as a data warehouse.

Enables users to run predefined SQL queries directly from the app interface.

Displays query results as interactive tables and charts using Streamlit.

Implements data modeling to support efficient joins and complex queries.

Helps users analyze video performance, audience engagement, and publishing trends.

A complete end-to-end project combining API integration, data engineering, and visualization.
